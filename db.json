      "body": "Event handling with portals is broken in the newest version when placing non-react event handlers BETWEEN other react event handlers. With the following setup **outer react event handler with stopPropagation** > **non-react event handler** > **inner react event handler (in portal)**. Doing the same without portals works correctly. React version: 17.0.1 ## Steps To Reproduce ### With portal (not working) 1. https://stackblitz.com/edit/ag-grid-react-hello-world-gwuhed?devtoolsheight=33&file=index.js 2. Click on the div 3. Only inner and outer event handlers are called ### Without portal (working) 1. https://stackblitz.com/edit/ag-grid-react-hello-world-gwuhed?devtoolsheight=33&file=index.js 2. Comment out the portal code and comment in the non-portal code (line 24 / 25) 3. Click on the div 4. All three event handlers are triggered Link to code example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/ag-grid-react-hello-world-gwuhed?devtoolsheight=33&file=index.js ## The current behavior Non-react event handlers are not called when the initial event is initiated from a portal component and an outer react event handler calls stop propagation. This works correctly without portals. ## The expected behavior The non-react event handler should also be called when a portal component initiates the event.",
